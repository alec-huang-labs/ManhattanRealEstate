## Manhattan Real Estate Project

I will be pulling recorded sales data from the [NYC Dept. of Finance](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page)

With the data, I will create an interactive [choropleth map](https://observablehq.com/@d3/choropleth) of recorded real estate sales within each neighborhood. The data will span from October 2019 -> September 2020.
